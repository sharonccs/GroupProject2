Topic: 
Electric Vehicle State of Charge Increase and Temperature

Dataset:

Approach

Using this data set, we will attempt to determine if there is a correlation between temperature and the percentage charging performed.

To do this we will perform a hypothesis test on the following null and alternative hypotheses:

H0 (Null Hypothesis): The average state of charge increase per day has no correlation with temperature
Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): The average state of charge increase per day is correlated with the temperature

Performing this hypothesis test will provide information about consumer behavior, and may assist EV charging outlets in tailoring their services to meet consumer demand.
